 ### CSV File Encryption Tool

The CSV File Encryption Tool is a simple Python application built with Tkinter that allows users to encrypt and decrypt CSV files using a specified key.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts the contents of a CSV file using a random permutation of characters in each field.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts previously encrypted CSV files using the correct decryption key.
- **Key Validation**: Validates the decryption key before performing decryption to ensure data integrity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the tool.
